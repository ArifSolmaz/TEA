Thermal Equilibrium Abundances (TEA), a code to calculate gaseous molecular
abundances under thermochemical equilibrium conditions.

This project was completed with the support of the NASA Earth and
Space Science Fellowship Program, grant NNX12AL83H, held by Jasmina
Blecic, Principal Investigator Joseph Harrington. Project developers
included graduate student Jasmina Blecic and undergraduate M. Oliver
Bowman.

Our intent is to release this software under an open-source,
reproducible-research license, once the code is mature and the first
research paper describing the code has been accepted for publication
in a peer-reviewed journal.  We are committed to development in the
open, and have posted this code on github.com so that others can test
it and give us feedback.  However, until its first publication and
first stable release, we do not permit others to redistribute the code
in either original or modified form, nor to publish work based in
whole or in part on the output of this code.  By downloading, running,

encourage sharing any modifications with us and discussing them
openly.

We welcome your feedback, but do not guarantee support.  Please send
